SCRAM V1_1_0 Release Notes
==========================


Version V1_1_0
--------------

	- Full support for XML in all SCRAM documents. Older document
	  markup is no longer supported (it is therefore a requirement
	  that all documents are migrated to proper XML syntax before
	  this release can be used).

	- Added support for new types of build products: plugin and
	  unittest. How these are handled by the Build System can be
	  controlled via the build templates.

	- Bug fixes (full details in the bug digest): #XXXX,
	  #YYYY,#ZZZZ
