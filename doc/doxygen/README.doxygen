Building Doxygen HTML Pages
===========================

Change directory to "doc/doxygen".

- Make sure that you have AT&T DOT somewhere at you site: edit
  "doxygen.sh" so that LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH have paths to your DOT
  install area.

- Make sure that you are able to run Doxygen v1.41 at least and modify
  the DOXYGEN variable accordingly.

- Run doxygen.sh. Documentation will be added under doc/doxygen/html.
